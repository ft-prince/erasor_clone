/**
 * I define a getUser query operation with an argument email of type string. This operation fetches user data based on the provided email from the database.
 * 
 * I define a createUser mutation operation with arguments name, email, and image, all of type string. This operation inserts a new user into the database with the provided data.







for get User 

It takes two parameters: ctx and args.

ctx likely stands for context and may contain additional contextual information or services needed for handling the query operation.
args contains the arguments passed to the query operation. In this case, it seems to contain an email argument.
Inside the function, it appears you're using ctx.db to interact with a database. This implies that ctx contains a reference to some database service or client.

You're querying the "user" collection/table from the database.

.query("user") suggests that you're querying the "user" entity.
.filter((q) => q.eq(q.field("email"), args.email)) filters the query to only include entries where the email matches the args.email.
.collect() collects the filtered results.
The filtered results are stored in the result variable.

Finally, the function returns the result.
